  <h1>TopSecret Project</h1>

  <p>The TopSecret project is a <a href=
  "http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> web application that
  provides an easy way for you to manage your passwords. Passwords are
  grouped into categories of your choosing, and are persisted to a
  database (typically <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>). The
  application itself is, of course, password protected.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

  <p>At the moment there is no documentation, other than this web page.
  Fortunately, running TopSecret is about as easy as any other Rails
  application.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Configure your database connection in
    <tt>config/database.yml</tt></li>

    <li>Create the database instance (e.g.
    <tt>topsecret_production</tt>)</li>

    <li>Create a config file for your LDAP server, which is used for
    logging into the application, by editing
    <tt>config/topsecret.yml</tt></li>

    <li>Start the application: <tt>./script/server</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Caveats</h2>

  <p>At the moment, TopSecret requires an LDAP server to authenticate
  anyone attempting to log in to the application. Naturally, this will
  be corrected at some point. One obvious alternative would be for
  TopSecret to maintain a set of users in the database, but this gets
  into the whole admin thing, which requires more views and probably
  some way to assign the admin password.</p>

  <h2>Getting Help</h2>

  <p>You can, of course, write to the author, but he would prefer that
  you use one of the <a href=
  "http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=3651">mailing lists</a>, that
  way questions that get answered are archived forever, so all will
  benefit.</p>
